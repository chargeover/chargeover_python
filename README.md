ChargeOver API Wrapper for Python

Configuration
-------------

Look at Configuration/API & Webhooks in your ChargeOver instance for
relevant configuration.

Dependencies
------------

All imports should be standard python modules.

Notes
-----

ChargeOver can be imported in interactive mode, interrogated with
help(), and operated completely in the interactive interpreter. When
connecting, set the "interactive" named parameter to true to allow
automatic pretty printing (CO method calls that support the named
parameter "pretty").

All of the JSON objects return are parsed into python dicts and lists.
